# Neural_Image_Classification_model

**Image Classification** : Make the model understand the difference between a Pizza and steak.

**CNN Model** : Convolutional Neural Network, it is an model used for Image Classification, It has 2 main layers :
1. CNN Layer : Convolutional Layer, it is used to extract the features from the images.
2. Pooling Layer : It is used to reduce the parameters extract the data which are more important than the other data.

**Datset** : The dataset contains 2000 images, 1000 for each object (Pizaa, Steak). Theses 1000 images are split into 750 and 250 images for training and testing respectively. 

**Steps to create an regression model :**

1. Import the required libraries
2. Loading the dataset
3. Data Visualisaation
4. Data Preprocessing
5. Splitting the dataset
6. Creating and evaluating our model
7. Experimenting with hyperparameters to increase the accuracy
