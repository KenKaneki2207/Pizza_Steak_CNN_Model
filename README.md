# Neural_Regression_model

**Regression** : Regression means trying to create a model to predict continous. It tries to understand the data and create a line in between the plotted points.

**ANN Model** : Artficial Neural Network, it is a mimic of neural network of neurons in our brain. 

**Datset** : The dataset contains 1338 rows x 7 cols. The columns are age, sex, bmi, no. of childrens, smoker(yes/no), region(north, south, west, east), charges(target variable)

**Steps to create an regression model :**

1. Import the required libraries
2. Loading the dataset
3. Data Visualisaation
4. Data Preprocessing
   a. One hot encoding 
   b. Scaling(normalizing)
   c. Splitting of the dataset
5. Creating and evaluating our model
